# Welcome to the thiccbois documentation for the "{{ customer.name }}" saltstack

Hi there, thanks for agreeing to let us modernise your infrastructure and introduce the start of the art
saltstack into your ops team.

What follows is a brief introduction to the basics of using salt from your salt master at {{ salt.master }}.

For best results, ssh into your salt-master and review the ["Getting Started"](getting-started.md) section.

```
ssh {{ salt.master }} -vvv
```
